# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
## Overview

### Overview of Analysis
For this analysis we were taking a closer look at employees that are close retiring to help a company better prepare for a large number of employees leaving. Our analysis will hopefully allow for the company to be better prepared for this "silver tsunami" and will be able to quickly fill the needed roles and keep the business running as usual. 

### Results
1. The most Senior Engineers are leaving so you will want to ensure that there are some other highly skilled engineers that can fill their shoes. 
2. There are 256,694 employees that are eligible for the mentorship the could help fill the space of the employees retiring
3. There are only 2 managers retiring so finding new managers is not as much of a concern
4. Replacing Senior Staff will also be a concern with it coming in as a close second to Senior Engineers


## Summary
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
In total 72,458 emmployees will be leaving as part of the silver tsunami all of their roles will need to be filled. 

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
If each retirement-ready employee is willing to mentor 3-4 mentorship eligible employees then there would be enough. This is a lot of work for a retirement-ready employee so it may be a large ask from Pewlett Hackard.
